Title: Geometric and Topological Methods for Machine Learning in Molecular Dynamics: A Historical and Practical Perspective

Speaker: Matthew Meeker

Abstract: Molecular dynamics simulations (MD) are essential to computational chemistry and materials science, providing atomic-scale insights into complex, dynamic processes such as protein folding, drug-receptor interactions, and material phase transitions that are often inaccessible experimentally. By integrating equations of motion, MD connects quantum to macroscopic scales, aiding drug discovery, materials engineering, and biomolecular studies. Yet, classical MD contends with high computational demands, extreme dimensionality in configuration spaces, and the imperative to maintain symmetries such as rotational invariance. This talk delves into recent advances with geometric and topological deep learning as scalable solutions, enhancing simulation speed while ensuring physical accuracy.

We will contextualize this all via scientific computing history, noting MD's preference for ODE approximations over intractable high-dimensional PDEs (eg., Liouville for phase-space flow or Fokker-Planck for ensembles). This necessitates statistical methods like Monte Carlo, which suffer from variance and slow mixing in complex landscapes. Geometric and topological DL overcomes these by incorporating priors: equivariant neural networks enforce $E(3)$ symmetries for efficient potentials, while persistent homology captures robust features in trajectories. Spotlighting advances like Allegro (scalable equivariant interatomic modeling), NequIP, MACE, and topological tools, we will present a few case studies in large-scale MD.
