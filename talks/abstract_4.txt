Title: The Reeb Transform

Speaker: Shankha Mukherjee

Abstract: Over the last decade, direction–based integral transforms have become foundational tools in geometric data analysis.  Two leading instances are the persistent‐homology transform (PHT) and the Euler‐characteristic transform (ECT), each of which assigns to a compact o–minimal subset of $\mathcal{R}^{d}$ a family of one–dimensional summaries obtained by sweeping the set with all height functions.  Both transforms are injective—hence full shape descriptors—but they sit at opposite ends of the cost–fidelity spectrum: the PHT is highly informative yet computationally demanding, whereas the ECT is lightweight but comparatively coarse.  Sitting naturally between these extremes is the Reeb Transform, formed by collecting, for every unit vector $v\in S^{d-1}$, the Reeb graph of the height function $h_{v}(x)=v\!\cdot x$.  Although Reeb graphs track only the evolution of \emph{connected components}, they capture richer structure than Euler curves while remaining cheaper than full persistence modules.

In this talk I will (1) review Reeb graphs, the PHT, and the ECT, positioning the Reeb Transform within this hierarchy; (2) prove that the Reeb Transform is injective for planar sets and for compact smooth surfaces in R^3 by converting vertex-degree data into Euler characteristics of slices; (3) exhibit explicit counter-examples showing that injectivity fails in dimensions four and higher; and (4) outline a local stability result that guarantees small shape perturbations leave the transform unchanged. These results clarify both the strengths and the intrinsic limitations of Reeb-based descriptors and suggest when they should be preferred in practical shape-analysis pipelines. This talk is joint work with Erin Chambers and Katharine Turner.
