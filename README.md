# Geometry & Topology in Machine Learning Seminar
**Summer 2025**  

This is a learning seminar on **geometry and topology in machine learning** in Summer 2025. The seminar runs from the week of **June 9th - June 13th** and to the week of **August 18th - August 22nd**. For more details, please see the [syllabus](syllabus.pdf).

## üóìÔ∏è Tentative Schedule

For the first 3 weeks, we will run 2 lectures per week, each roughly 1 hour long. We will follow the schedule below:
### Part A: Groups and Representations
- [Lecture 1](lectures/lecture_1.pdf) (June 9th) | Soft introduction to machine learning, neural networks, convolutional and graph neural networks, with an eye towards geometry and topology.
- Lecture 2 (June 13rd) | Introduction to groups, representations, vector bundles, principle G-bundles, gauge theory.
- Lecture 3 (June 16th) | Applications of representations and gauge theory (equivariant machine learning).

### Part B: Manifolds
- Lecture 4 (June 20th) | Introduction to differentiable manifolds.
- Lecture 5 (June 23rd) | Introduction to Riemannian manifolds.
- Lecture 6 (June 27th) | Applications of manifolds in machine learning.

### Paper Presentations

The remaining weeks of the seminar will be paper presentations. Volunteered participants from the seminar would give presentations on a research paper of their choice related to this seminar.
