# Geometry & Topology in Machine Learning Seminar
**Summer 2025**  

This is a learning seminar on **geometry and topology in machine learning** in Summer 2025. The seminar runs from the week of **June 9th - June 13th** and to the week of **August 18th - August 22nd**. For more details, please see the (original) [syllabus](syllabus.pdf).

## üóìÔ∏è Tentative Schedule

### Minicourse
From June 9th to June 30th 2025, we ran a 6-lecture minicourse on **geometric deep learning** focusing on two themes - (A) Groups and Representations, and (B) Manifolds. We followed the schedule below:
### Part A: Groups and Representations
- [Lecture 1](lectures/lecture_1.pdf) (June 9th) | Soft introduction to machine learning, neural networks, convolutional and graph neural networks, with an eye towards geometry and topology.
- [Lecture 2](lectures/lecture_2.pdf) (June 13rd) | Introduction to groups, representations, vector bundles, principle G-bundles, gauge theory.
- [Lecture 3](lectures/lecture_3.pdf) (June 16th) | Equivariant and convolutional neural networks on homogeneous spaces and examples.

### Part B: Manifolds
- [Lecture 4](lectures/lecture_4.pdf) (June 20th) | Introduction to differentiable manifolds. Tangent and cotangent spaces/bundles, normal bundles, smooth maps, regular value theorem, Lie groups and Lie algebras, boundary and orientations.
- [Lecture 5](lectures/lecture_5.pdf) (June 23rd) | Introduction to Riemannian manifolds, constructing feature spaces in Coordinate-Independent CNNs, gauge theory and G-structures, Mobius Band CNN as an example. ([Annotated version](lectures/lecture_5_annotated.pdf))
- [Lecture 6](lectures/lecture_6.pdf) (June 30th) | ore on Coordinate-Independent CNNs: Convolutions and Isometry. 1x1 GM-convolutions, Kernel Field Transformations, and GM-convolutions, Isometry Equivariance.

The main reference for **Part A** is
```
Taco Cohen, Mario Geiger, Maurice Weiler. A general theory of equivariant CNNs on homogeneous spaces.
```
The main reference for **Part B** is
```
Maurice Weiler, Patrick Forr√©, Erik Verlinde, Max Welling. Equivariant and Coordinate Independent Convolutional Networks: A Gauge Field Theory of Neural Networks
```
Note that much of **Part A** is also discussed in the main reference for **Part B**. 

### Paper Presentations

The remaining weeks of the seminar will be paper presentations. Volunteered participants from the seminar would give presentations on a research paper (or an academic topic in general) of their choice related to this seminar.
